This final project had several different lessons. The first was understanding how equals and hashcode must be redfined, based on your definition of what equality was. It took about two days to implement all of the functions we wanted for the Graph class for Stage 1. Those were fairly simple to implement. The next three days, I worked on completing the traversals. The first two days, I got BFT and DFT to work, but Shortest Path took me the rest of the second day and the next day to debug. That was an algorithm that had a lot of layers and data to keep track of, so it's fair that it took more time to implement. Then, implementing the check function took a bit of time to make sure that I had all the possible checks. 
In the beginning, I chose to make directed graphs because why not? Alice was already talking about what I would have had to do if I was going to make a directed graph class, so I decided on it. However, I realized after getting my Stage 1 comments back, there were just too many things to keep track of, so I switched back to undirected graphs. 
One thing that gave me trouble was redefining the ShortestPath method to implement a specific type of graph. For some reason, as I try to call the function in the GUI, it doesn't work even when I redefine it. I thought it may have been an issue with the argument types, but I couldn't figure it out. I've tested the Shortest Path method before, so I know that it works, but I don't know why it gives an error that method does not exist. 
Another error that I saw a lot was when I would get the data of a node or an edge, DisplayNodeData or DisplayEdgeData, which hold the information such as cost, label, and color, the program would see it as an Object rather than DisplayNodeData or DisplayEdgeData. I thought this was really strange, and I still don't understand it. How I fixed it is also a mystery to me, it could have been that I needed to state the generic types of Graph somewhere. 
This final assignment was quite stressful because of the time constraint. I think if we had one more day, I could've figured out what happened with the shortest path algorithm. 
Thanks for the semester, Professor!
